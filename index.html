    party was over And our time on Earth was through I'd wanna hold you just for
    a while And die with a smile If the world was ending I'd wanna be next to
    you Right next to you Next to you Right next to you Oh-oh If the world was
    ending I'd wanna be next to you If the party was over And our time on Earth
    was through I'd wanna hold you just for a while And die with a smile If the
    world was ending I'd wanna be next to you If the world was ending I'd wanna
    be next to you I'd wanna be next to you
